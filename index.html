</p>
   Hi! My name is Purvi Somashekar and I am currently an 8th grader in William Hopkins Middle School!
</p>
</p>I love to read books and spend time with my family. I also love to dance. I have been dancing for about 8 years now. I am also an extremely productive person when there is something I am interested in. 
</p>
</p> If there is something that I gain interest in, then I focus on that topic and make sure I learn as much as I possibly can. 
</p> 
</p> I love to travel to many different places. I am also part of Troop 30113 in Girl Scouts, I simply love to sell cookies and see all the happy faces whenever they buy the cookies!
